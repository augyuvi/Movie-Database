# Movie Database ðŸŽ¬

This is my Movie Database project built during Masterschool training on Codio.  
It lets me create user profiles, add movies, update or delete them, and even generate a personal HTML website with posters.

## Features
- Multiple user profiles (each user has their own movie list)
- Add, delete, update, and search movies
- View stats: average, median, best, and worst movies
- Filter and sort movies by rating or year
- Generate a personal website with posters (saved in `_static/`)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:augyuvi/Movie-Database.git
   cd Movie-Database

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the program:
python3 movies.py


For Example:
Welcome to the Movie App ðŸŽ¬

Select a user:
1. Nithya
2. Create new user

Enter choice: 1
Welcome back, Nithya!
